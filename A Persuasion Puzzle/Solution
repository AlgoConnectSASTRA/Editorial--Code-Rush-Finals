1. Have a variable (let's call it **result**) for keeping track of the days where you scored the perfect score.
2. Declare a variable (let's call it **sum**) to keep track of the T-shirts sold so far.
3. Iterate through the array,
    a. Update the sum in each iteration. 
    b. If the (sum/current day)*10 is equal to 10, increment the result by 1
        i) If it's a zero-indexed array, then current day = i+1
        ii) If it's one-indexed, then current day = i
4. Return the result
