There are two cases of inputs:

1. An array with combination of both odd and even numbers
2. An array with all elements either odd or even numbers

Case 1:

Combination of both odd and even numbers

When the array contains a mix of odd and even elements, the minimum possible GCD that can be obtained is 1.
Therefore, we simply return the length of the array, as each element will contribute a GCD of 1.

Case 2: 

All even or odd elements

In this case, we can find the lowest and highest numbers in the array. Their greatest common divisor (GCD) represents the minimum possible GCD for the entire array.
Thus, we return the product of the length of the array and this calculated GCD.

Time complexity: O(n)

If we want to make the code simpler, we can take GCD of all elements, thus O(nlogn) time complexity.
