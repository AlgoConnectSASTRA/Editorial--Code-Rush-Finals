1. Initialize two frequency arrays to count the occurrences of characters in both strings.
2. Loop through each character in the strings and update the frequency arrays.
3. Then Iterate through these frequency arrays and get the minimum frequency at each index.
4. Store the maximum value among these minimum frequencies in a variable.
5. Output this variable which is the minium length of LCS that can be obtained.
