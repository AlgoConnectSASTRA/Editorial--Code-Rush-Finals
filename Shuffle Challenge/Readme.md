1. Initialize two frequency arrays to count the occurrences of characters in both strings.
2. Loop through each character in the strings and update the frequency arrays.
3. Then Iterate through these frequency arrays and calculate the minimum frequency of the same character in both strings.
4. Store the maximum among these minimum frequencies in variable.
5. Output this variable which is the minium length of LCS that can be obtained.
